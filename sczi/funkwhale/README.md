# Funkwhale

Guide: https://docs.funkwhale.audio/installation/docker.html


## Configuration

Follow the guide linked above, except our nginx config is done in the nginx app



### Importing music

Read https://docs.funkwhale.audio/importing-music.html first.

VTLUUG's main (`MEDIA_DIRECTORY_SERVER_PATH` in `.env`) music folder is `/nfs/cistern/share/media/music`.



## Running it

RTFM (Seriously! It has very good documentation).
